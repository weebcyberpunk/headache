# Brainfuck interpreter

Brainfuck interpreter I wrote in about a hour and a half. Not much to say about
it.

[what the fuck?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

# Brainfucking

Compile with `make`.

Run the binary with the Brainfuck script as the only arg. Example scripts are on
the `examples/` directory.

If compiling with the `DEBUG` flag (or `debug` make target), it'll dump the
state before exiting.
